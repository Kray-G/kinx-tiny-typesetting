### Markdown to PDF

#### Markdown Source

```markdown
# Introduction

First, this section introduces a KiTTy itself and shows a comparison to alternative softwares,
and introduces a value of KiTTy and use case of KiTTy.
And also, it shows supported features.

## What is KiTTy

**KiTTy** means **Ki**nx **T**iny **Ty**pesetting,
which is a simple typesetting system implemented by Kinx.
It also provides a translator from Markdown,
then you can typeset a Markdown document and can get a beautiful document.
This document itself is also the example typeset by this system.

The objective is similar to \\LaTeX, it is an objective to typeset beautifully for a document managed as a text file.
To be concretely, it is never going to be alternative,
but the objective is being more useful in the use case like your personal situation by followings.

*   Keeping a small system.
*   Pretty beautiful output.
*   Directly output as PDF file.

KiTTy is small but it has a simple feature to typeset it beautifully,
and it is a typesetting system to output PDF directly from Markdown document.

### Versus \\LaTeX

\\LaTeX is a huge system.
It is extendable, it is supported by many people, and it is a typesetting system which can make a beautiful document.
KiTTy is also a typesetting system which has a same objective as \\LaTeX,
but it is provided as a small system with limited features.

Being huge of \\LaTeX system causes a complexibility of an installation.
Besides, there are multiple distributions to provide many functionality of \\TeX and \\LaTeX.
That is the reason why people have to think first what distribution should be used.
Everybody can use KiTTy soon because KiTTy is included in Kinx as a standard library,

Only one cons point is that limited features[^1] are provided.
And also the compilation speed is *slow*.
It takes about 4 minutes to compile this document.
The performance is one of problems,
but this system is focusing what is used as a small and a personal use.

[^1]: About ''limited features'', see \\nameref{Features Overview}.
